    "\n",
    "*We introduce and describe an iterative algorithm of the Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE), known as the Iterative QAE (IQAE). This is used for estimating credit risk that outperforms Monte Carlo (MC) simulations on traditional computers. We calculate the Economic Capital (EC) required, which is the difference between the Value at Risk (VaR) and the predicted Loss Distribution Value (LDV). The calculation of the EC required is of interest, because it quantifies the amount of capital required to be solvent at a certain level of confidence, making it an important risk statistic. We implement this problem for a realistic LDV and analyze its scaling to a realistic problem size. We present estimates of the overall number of necessary qubits, the expected circuit depth, and how this translates into an expected runtime on future fault-tolerant quantum hardware under acceptable assumptions.*"

    "\n",
    "The credit risk analysis is a form of analysis performed (normally by a credit analyst) to determine a borrower’s ability to meet their debt obligations. The purpose of credit risk analysis is to determine the creditworthiness of borrowers by quantifying the risk of loss that the lender is exposed to. The three factors that lenders use to quantify credit risk include: the probability of default, the loss given of default, and exposure of default. [[1]](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/credit/purpose-of-credit-risk-analysis/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The usage of quantum computers could allow faster and more accurate solutions, for example, to determinate the credit risk profile of a client. It is said that financial institutions that can make the most of quantum computing are likely to see significant benefits. Banks and asset managers optimize portfolios based on computationally intense models that process large sets of variables, and for this reason, they will be able to more effectively analyze large or unstructured data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In valuation, for example, the ability to speedily identify an optimal risk-adjusted portfolio is likely to create significant competitive advantage. For loan and bond portfolios, more precise estimates of credit exposures should lead to better optimization decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "American and European banks are also exploring quantum computing opportunities. [[2]](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/how-quantum-computing-could-change-financial-services)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bank of America strategist said quantum computing would be: \"as revolutionary in the 2020s as smartphones were in the 2010s\".\n",
    "- BBVA has formed a partnership to explore portfolio optimization and more efficient Monte Carlo modelling.\n",
    "- Caixa Bank is running a trial hybrid framework of quantum and conventional computing with the aim of better classifying credit risk profiles."

    "## 2. Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe the problem as the simple default risk, that a lender takes on in the chance that a borrower will be unable to make the required payments on their debt obligation. Whenever a lender extends credit to a borrower, there is a chance that the loan amount will not be paid back. The measurement that looks at this probability is the default risk. \n",
    "\n",
    "The default risk applies to both individuals who borrow money, and companies that issue bonds and due to financial constraints, are not able to make interest payments on those bonds. Whenever a lender extends credit, calculating the default risk of a borrower is crucial as part of its risk management strategy. Whenever an investor is evaluating an investment, determining the financial health of a company or private person is crucial in gauging investment risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lenders generally examine a company's financial statements and employ several financial ratios to determine the likelihood of debt repayment. Free cash flow is the cash that is generated after the company reinvests in itself and is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow. Free cash flow is used for things such as debt and dividend payments. A free cash flow figure that is near zero or negative indicates that the company may be having trouble generating the cash necessary to deliver on promised payments. This could indicate a higher default risk. The default risk on a debt arises from a borrower failing to make the required payments, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A consumer may fail to make a payment due on a mortgage loan, credit card, line of credit, or other loan.\n",
    "- A company is unable to repay asset-secured fixed or floating charge debt.\n",
    "- A business or consumer does not pay a trade invoice when due."

Thus, given a concrete realization of $Z$ the individual default events are assumed to be independent from each other.\n",

    "In order to further demonstrate the capabilities of IQAE, we used classical simulations of quantum hardware to show that it can also be applied to speed up the computation of risk measures of a simple two-asset (2) portfolio. Nevertheless, we notice that to achieve quantum advantage in a real-world scenario, the quality of current quantum hardware needs to be improved. Errors arising from the limited coherence time and cross-talk when measuring the states of qubits need to be substantially suppressed. Furthermore, because of this reason, the number of qubits must be increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "We went on to show how IQAE can be applied to the task of pricing an asset using real quantum hardware. However, the current pace of advances in research directed at improving both quantum hardware and quantum algorithms makes us optimistic that real quantum advantage in risk analysis can be achieved in the future.\n",

    "\n",
    "Value at risk (VaR) is a statistic that quantifies the extent of possible financial losses within a firm, portfolio, or position over a specific time frame. The CVar quantifies the average expected loss. A financial firm, for example, may determine an asset has a 3% one-month VaR of 2%, representing a 3% chance of the asset declining in value by 2% during the one-month time frame. The conversion of the 3% chance of occurrence to a daily ratio places the odds of a 2% loss at one day per month."

    "### 3.2. Classical Method: Monte Carlo (MC)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Monte Carlo (MC) method is a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. MC predicts a set of outcomes based on an estimated range of values versus a set of fixed input values. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a MC simulation builds a model of possible results by leveraging a probability distribution, such as a uniform or normal distribution, for any variable that has inherent uncertainty. It recalculates the results over and over, each time using a different set of random numbers between the minimum and maximum values. In a typical MC experiment, this exercise can be repeated thousands of times to produce a large number of likely outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind MC integration is to estimate the area under a (high dimensional) surface by taking random points and counting how many fall. The error goes down like the reciprocal of the square root of the number of points. The error estimate has nothing to do with the dimension, in that sense, MC integration is indeed independent of dimension, and for that reason is often used for numerical integration in dimensions too high to use product methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this is translated into software, those n dimensions are the equivalent of a software with n features. If there are no points in the region of interest, we would estimate the volume of the region of interest to be zero. The volume is very small, and the absolute error in estimating a small number to be zero is small, but the relative is 100%. Several combinations of different scenarios are tested and the result of each scenario is analyzed, and for this reason, it’s slow and expensive."

    "### 3.3. Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE)\n",
    "\n",
    "QAE is one of the algorithms at the basis of the quantum revolution, it can be understood as a combination of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and Grover Algorithm. It is useful to estimate the VaR, and has the potential to achieve a quadratic speed up for most of the application that are nowadays solved through Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, while these simulations scale with $𝒪(1/\\sqrt{M})$ with $M$ the number of samples, QAE achieve a scaling of $𝒪(1/M)$, where $M$ are the quantum samples. It has been shown that we can leverage QAE in the financial service sector, e.g., for risk analysis, option pricing, and also for generic tasks such as numerical integration. However, we do not provide rigorous proofs of the correctness of the proposed algorithms. It is not even clear how to control the accuracy of the algorithm other than possibly increasing the number of measurements of the evolving quantum circuits.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we propose an alternative version of QAE, the Iterative QAE (IQAE). It achieves better results than previous tested algorithms. It requires iterative queries to the quantum computer to achieve the quadratic speedup and cannot be parallelized. Although parallelization is a nice feature, the potential speedup is limited. Assuming the length of the queries is doubled in each iteration, the speedup is at most a factor of two since the computationally most expensive query dominates all the others. Has the desired asymptotic behavior up to a multiplicative $\\log{(2/\\alpha \\log{2(\\pi/ 4 \\epsilon)})}$ factor, where $ϵ > 0$ denotes the target accuracy, and $1 − α$ the resulting confidence level. [[8]](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41534-021-00379-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Before showing the results of applying the IQAE algorithm, we will discuss the mapping of the problem in the quantum operator $A$, discuss about the operator $Q$, how to map the uncertainty model in a quantum register, and how the problem of the expected loss is mapped in a quantum circuit. This improves the results without additional queries to the quantum computer and allows us to derive proper confidence intervals."

To find the marked item using classical computation, one would have to check on average ${N\\over2}$ of these boxes, and in the worst case, all $N$ of them. On a quantum computer, however, we can find the marked item in roughly $√N$ steps with Grover's algorithm.\n",

    "#### 3.3.2. Quantum Fourier Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fourier Transform occurs in many different versions throughout classical computing, in areas ranging from signal processing to data compression to complexity theory. The Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) is the quantum equivalent implementation of the discrete Fourier Transform over the amplitudes of a wavefunction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete Fourier transform acts on a vector $(x0,...,x_{N−1})$ and maps it to the vector $(y0,...,y_{N−1})$ according to the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}x_j\\omega_N^{jk} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where: $ \\omega_N^{jk} = e^{2\\pi i \\frac{jk}{N}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, QFT acts on a quantum state $ \\vert X\\rangle = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} x_j \\vert j \\rangle $ and maps it to the quantum state $ \\vert Y\\rangle = \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} y_k \\vert k \\rangle $ according to the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y_k = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}x_j\\omega_N^{jk} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We see that only the amplitudes of the state were affected by this transformation. This can also be expressed as the unitary matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ U_{QFT} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\sum_{k=0}^{N-1} \\omega_N^{jk} \\vert k \\rangle \\langle j \\vert $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The QFT transforms between two bases, the computational (Z) basis, and the Fourier basis. The H-gate is the single-qubit QFT, and it transforms between the Z-basis states $|0⟩$ and $|1⟩$ to the X-basis states $|+⟩$ and $|−⟩$. In the same way, all multi-qubit states in the computational basis have corresponding states in the Fourier basis. The QFT is simply the function that transforms between these bases.\n",

    "\n",
    "![fourier-basis](assets/plot/fourierbasis-counting.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "The number we want to store dictates the angle at which each qubit is rotated around the Z-axis. In the state $|\\widetilde{0}\\rangle$, all qubits are in the state $|\\widetilde{+}\\rangle$. As seen in the example above, to encode the state $|\\widetilde{5}\\rangle$ on 4 qubits, we rotated the leftmost qubit by $\\tfrac{5}{2^n} = \\tfrac{5}{16}$ full turns ($\\tfrac{5}{16}\\times 2\\pi$ radians). The next qubit is turned double this radians, $\\tfrac{10}{16}\\times 2\\pi$, this angle is then doubled for the qubit after, and so on. Note the frequency of each changing qubit, the leftmost qubit (qubit 0) in this case has the lowest frequency, and the rightmost the highest."

    "## 5. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, most people have heard that quantum computing is a revolutionary technology that leverages the bizarre characteristics of quantum mechanics to solve certain problems faster than regular computers can. Those problems range from the worlds of mathematics to retail business, and physics to finance. But, as we have seen recently, quantum computers (QC) are exceedingly difficult to engineer, build and program. As a result, they are crippled by errors in the form of noise, faults and loss of quantum coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "While classical computers (CC) are also affected by various sources of errors, these errors can be corrected with a modest amount of extra storage and logic. Quantum error­ correction schemes do exist but consume such a large number of qubits that relatively few qubits remain for actual computation. So when only a couple of qubits are required it could be feasible, but when the number required increases the computing is not viable. This reduces the size of the computing task to a tiny fraction of what could run on defect-­free hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, all in all, the application of this quantum algorithm (or quantum computing in general) is not feasible due to the noise and the quantity of qubits required."
