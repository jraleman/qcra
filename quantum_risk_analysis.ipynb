    "## Abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce and examine a quantum algorithm for estimating credit risk that outperforms Monte Carlo simulations on traditional computers. We calculate the economic capital required, which is the difference between the Value at Risk (VaR) and the predicted loss distribution value (LDV). The calculation of the economic capital required is of interest, because it quantifies the amount of capital required to be solvent at a certain level of confidence, making it an important risk statistic. We implement this problem for a realistic loss distribution and analyze its scaling to a realistic problem size. We present estimates of the overall number of necessary qubits, the expected circuit depth, and how this translates into an expected runtime on future fault-tolerant quantum hardware under acceptable assumptions."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Credit risk analysis is a form of analysis performed by a credit analyst to determine a borrower’s ability to meet their debt obligations. The purpose of credit analysis is to determine the creditworthiness of borrowers by quantifying the risk of loss that the lender is exposed to. The three factors that lenders use to quantify credit risk include the probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of quantum computing could allow faster and accurate solutions, for example determining a credit risk profile of a client. It is said that financial institutions that can make the most of quantum computing are likely to see significant benefits. Banks and asset managers optimize portfolios based on computationally intense models that process large sets of variables. For this reason, they will be able to more effectively analyze large or unstructured data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In valuation, for example, the ability to speedily identify an optimal risk-adjusted portfolio is likely to create significant competitive advantage. For loan and bond portfolios, more precise estimates of credit exposures should lead to better optimization decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "American and European banks are also exploring quantum computing opportunities. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bank of America strategist said quantum computing would be “as revolutionary in the 2020s as smartphones were in the 2010s.”\n",
    "- BBVA has formed a partnership to explore portfolio optimization and more efficient Monte Carlo modelling.\n",
    "- Caixa Bank is running a trial hybrid framework of quantum and conventional computing with the aim of better classifying credit risk profiles."

    "## Description of the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Default risk is the risk that a lender takes on in the chance that a borrower will be unable to make the required payments on their debt obligation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a lender extends credit to a borrower, there is a chance that the loan amount will not be paid back. The measurement that looks at this probability is the default risk. Default risk does not only apply to individuals who borrow money, but also to companies that issue bonds and due to financial constraints, are not able to make interest payments on those bonds. Whenever a lender extends credit, calculating the default risk of a borrower is crucial as part of its risk management strategy. Whenever an investor is evaluating an investment, determining the financial health of a company or private person is crucial in gauging investment risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lenders generally examine a company's financial statements and employ several financial ratios to determine the likelihood of debt repayment. Free cash flow is the cash that is generated after the company reinvests in itself and is calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from operating cash flow. Free cash flow is used for things such as debt and dividend payments. A free cash flow figure that is near zero or negative indicates that the company may be having trouble generating the cash necessary to deliver on promised payments. This could indicate a higher default risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "The risk of default on a debt arises from a borrower failing to make the required payments, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A consumer may fail to make a payment due on a mortgage loan, credit card, line of credit, or other loan.\n",
    "- A company is unable to repay asset-secured fixed or floating charge debt.\n",
    "- A business or consumer does not pay a trade invoice when due"

Thus, given a concrete realization of $Z$ the individual default events are assumed to be independent from each other.\n",

In a typical Monte Carlo experiment, this exercise can be repeated thousands of times to produce a large number of likely outcomes.\n",

    "In this section, we introduce Grover's algorithm and how it can be used to solve unstructured search problems. This algorithm can speed up an unstructured search problem quadratically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you are given a large list of $N$ items. Among these items there is one item with a unique property that we wish to locate; we will call this one the winner $w$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To find the the marked item using classical computation, one would have to check on average ${N\\over2}$ of these boxes, and in the worst case, all $N$ of them. On a quantum computer, however, we can find the marked item in roughly $√N$ steps with Grover's algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at the list of items, we have no idea where the marked item is. Therefore, any guess of its location is as good as any other, which can be expressed in terms of a uniform superposition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|s \\rangle = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}} \\sum_{x = 0}^{N -1} | x\n",
    "\\rangle.$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Our chances of guessing the right value $w$ is therefore $1$ in $2^n$, as could be expected. Hence, on average we would need to try about ${N\\over2} = 2^{n-1}$ times to guess the correct item.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm has a nice geometrical interpretation in terms of two reflections, which generate a rotation in a two-dimensional plane. The only two special states we need to consider are the winner $|w⟩$ and the uniform superposition $|s⟩$. These two vectors span a two-dimensional plane in the vector space $\\mathbb{C}^n$.\n",

    "They are not quite perpendicular because $|w⟩$ occurs in the superposition with amplitude $N^{-1/2}$ as well. We can, however, introduce an additional state $|s′⟩$ that is in the span of these two vectors, which is perpendicular to $|w⟩$ and is obtained from $|s⟩$ by removing $|w⟩$ and rescaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The amplitude amplification procedure starts out in the uniform superposition $|s⟩$, which is easily constructed from:\n",

    "\n",
    "The right graphic is a bar graph of the amplitudes of the state $|s⟩$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We apply the oracle reflection $U_f$ to the state $|s⟩$:\n",
    "\n",
    "![grover-step2](assets/diagrams/grover-step2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Geometrically this corresponds to a reflection of the state $|s⟩$ about $|s′⟩$. This transformation means that the amplitude in front of the $|w⟩$ state becomes negative, which in turn means that the average amplitude (indicated by a dashed line) has been lowered.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We now apply an additional reflection $(U_s)$  about the state\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ |s\\rangle:U_s = 2|s\\rangle\\langle s| - \\mathbb{1} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This transformation maps the state to $ U_s U_f| s \\rangle $ and completes the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "![grover-step3](assets/diagrams/grover-step3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Two reflections always correspond to a rotation. The transformation $U_sU_f$ rotates the initial state $|s⟩$ closer towards the winner $|w⟩$. The action of the reflection \n",
    "$U_s$ in the amplitude bar diagram can be understood as a reflection about the average amplitude. Since the average amplitude has been lowered by the first reflection, this transformation boosts the negative amplitude of $|w⟩$ to roughly three times its original value, while it decreases the other amplitudes. We then go to step 2 to repeat the application. This procedure will be repeated several times to zero in on the winner.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We went on to show how our algorithm can be applied to the task of pricing an asset using real quantum hardware. We chose the simple model of a treasury bill whose value depends only on the interest rate. This simple experiment on 5 qubits confirmed the theoretical convergence rate of our algorithm and underlines its potential advantage compared to classical Monte Carlo methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to further demonstrate the capabilities of our algorithm, we used classical simulations of quantum hardware to show that it can also be applied to speed up the computation of risk measures of a simple two-asset portfolio. Nevertheless, we notice that to achieve quantum advantage in a real-world scenario, the quality of current quantum hardware needs to be improved. Errors arising from the limited coherence time and cross-talk when measuring the states of qubits need to be substantially suppressed. Furthermore, the number of qubits must be increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the current pace of advances in research directed at improving both quantum hardware and quantum algorithms makes us optimistic that real quantum advantage in risk analysis can be achieved in the future."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, most people have heard that quantum computing is a revolutionary technology that leverages the bizarre characteristics of quantum mechanics to solve certain problems faster than regular computers can. Those problems range from the worlds of mathematics to retail business, and physics to finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, as we have seen this year, Quantum computers are exceedingly difficult to engineer, build and program. As a result, they are crippled by errors in the form of noise, faults and loss of quantum coherence.\n",
    "\n",
    "While classical computers are also affected by various sources of errors, these errors can be corrected with a modest amount of extra storage and logic. Quantum error­ correction schemes do exist but consume such a large number of qubits (quantum bits) that relatively few qubits remain for actual computation. So when only a couple of qubits are required it could be feasible, but when the number required increases the computing is unviable.   That reduces the size of the computing task to a tiny fraction of what could run on defect-­free hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, all in all, the application of this quantum algorithm (or quantum computing in general) is not feasible due to the noise and the quantity of qubits required."
