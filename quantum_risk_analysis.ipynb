    "\n",
    "Credit risk analysis is a form of analysis performed by a credit analyst to determine a borrower’s ability to meet their debt obligations. The purpose of credit analysis is to determine the creditworthiness of borrowers by quantifying the risk of loss that the lender is exposed to. The three factors that lenders use to quantify credit risk include the probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default. [1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of quantum computing could allow faster and accurate solutions, for example determining a credit risk profile of a client. It is said that financial institutions that can make the most of quantum computing are likely to see significant benefits. Banks and asset managers optimize portfolios based on computationally intense models that process large sets of variables. For this reason, they will be able to more effectively analyze large or unstructured data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In valuation, for example, the ability to speedily identify an optimal risk-adjusted portfolio is likely to create significant competitive advantage. For loan and bond portfolios, more precise estimates of credit exposures should lead to better optimization decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "American and European banks are also exploring quantum computing opportunities. [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bank of America strategist said quantum computing would be “as revolutionary in the 2020s as smartphones were in the 2010s.”\n",
    "- BBVA has formed a partnership to explore portfolio optimization and more efficient Monte Carlo modelling.\n",
    "- Caixa Bank is running a trial hybrid framework of quantum and conventional computing with the aim of better classifying credit risk profiles."
