    "\n",
    "- Economic capital is the amount of risk capital, which a firm requites to cover the risks that is running, or as a on going concern, such as a credit risk (CR), which is the monetary loss resulting from the other party failing to meet the financial obligation agreed upon. [1]\n",
    "- Risk metrics, like Value at Risk (VaR) and the Economic Capital Reruirement (ECR) are often calculated for different scenarios. For this reason, the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is the method of choice for this task.\n",
    "- However, evaluating CR with MC is a rare-event simulation problem, which requires many samples, thereby making MC computationally intensive.\n",
    "- Importance sampling reduces the com- putational cost by lowering the constants but does not change the asymptotic rate of convergence (quantities that represent how quickly the sequence approaches its limit) [2].\n",
    "- It has been shown how the Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) algorithm can be used to analyze financial risk measures [3] or to price financial derivatives [4] with a quadratic speedup."

    "\n",
    "TODO:\n",
    "- Formally define the economic capital requirement as well as the two different uncertainty models considered.\n",
    "- ECR summarizes in a single figure the amount of capital (or own funds) required to remain solvent at a given confidence level (usually linked to the risk appetite or target solvency rating) and a time horizon (usually one year).\n",
    "- It is a complementary metric to the regulatory capital requirements that refers to the amount of own funds required following regulatory criteria and rules [16].\n",
    "- In this paper, we consider only the ECR related to default risk, which is the loss that occurs when an obligor does not fulfill the repayment of a loan.\n",
    "- The main components of an ECR model for a portfolio of assets are the singleasset default probabilities, the loss given default, and the correlation among the single-asset default events.\n",
    "- In the following, we first introduce a general form of the credit risk analysis problem considered in this manuscript and then define concrete models in detail.\n",
    "- For a portfolio of $K$ assets the multivariate random variable $(L_1, ..., L_K) ∈ R_K ≥ 0 $ denotes each possible loss associated to each asset. "
